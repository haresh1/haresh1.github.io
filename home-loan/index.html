<p>Once a client has decided to purchase a flat in our Project, Finance plays a critical role in the purchase of your home. The important issues that are to be considered include modes of arranging finance and we provide the necessary guidance and assistance in obtaining finance through Housing Loans from various Banks. It is generally safe to take a loan from one of the leading Banks.</p>

<p>Often  the customers are confused about how to  obtain Home Loans from the Banks like :</p>


<p>1. What are the types of home loans?</p>
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span> There are a variety of loans  available for purchasing of homes. </p>

<p>2. Can a Non Resident Indian avail of the Housing loans?</p>
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>  Yes, majority of the Banks give such loans depending upon the eligibility criteria and policy of the concerned Bank.</p>

<p>3. How much a person can borrow?</p>
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>Loans are generally sanctioned upto 80% of the cost of the property. The balance money is to be funded by the purchaser from his own contribution. The percentage of loan would vary from bank to bank.</p>

<p>4. How is the rate calculated in India?
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>Interest rates vary from time to time and from bank to bank. The interest calculated either on a daily or monthly reducing or yearly reducing balances.</p>

<p>5. What is a fixed rate housing loan ?
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>A fixed-rate housing loan is a loan where the rate of interest is constant through the entire term of the loan period.</P>

<p>6. What is the difference between monthly reducing interest rate and yearly reducinginterestrate?   </p>                              
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span> In a monthly reducing interest system the principal on which interest is paid reduces every month as EMI is paid. In the annual reducing system the principal is reduced at the end of the year, and the borrower pays interest on a certain portion of the principle, which is actually paid back to the lender. The EMI for the monthly reducing system is effectively lesser than the yearly reducing system of calculating interest.</p>

<p>9. What are the other costs that usually accompany a home loan? </p>
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>Home loans are usually accompanied by the following extra cost: 
Processing Charge: It's a fee payable to the financial institution on applying for a loan. It is either a fixed amount not linked to the loan or may also be a percentage of the loan amount. The loan amount required by you cannot be less than the processing fee.</P>
<p>Pre-payment Penalties: When a loan is paid back before the end of the agreed duration, a penalty is charged by some banks/companies, which is usually between 1% and 2% of the amount being pre-paid. Some Banks allows upto 20% part payment of a loan in a year without any pre-payment charges.</p>
<p>Commitment Fees: A commitment fee is charged in case the loan is not availed of within a stipulated period of time after it is processed and sanctioned. However, now a days most banks / institutions do not levy it.</p>
<p> Miscellaneous Costs: Sometimes Banks may levy a documentation or consultant charges.</p>

<p>10. What security is required for a housing loan?</p>
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>In most cases, the property to be purchased itself becomes the security and is mortgaged to the lending institution till the entire loan is repaid. Some institutions may ask for additional security such as life insurance policies, FD receipts and share or savings certificates.</p>

<p>11. Do the Banks require guarantors? </p>    
<p><span class="ans">&gt;&gt; </span>Many Banks don’t ask for Guarantors. One can have co-applicant instead. However, in certain cases 1 or 2 guarantors may be required if the borrower’s profile is not sound.</p>

<p>12. What is the time required for Banks, for approving a loan?</p>
